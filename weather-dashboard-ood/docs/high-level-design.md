# Weather Dashboard: High-Level Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level design for a Weather Dashboard application, demonstrating Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles in Python. The design aims to provide a clear structure for implementing a flexible, extensible, and maintainable weather application.

## 2. System Overview

The Weather Dashboard application allows users to fetch, process, and visualise weather data from various sources. It employs OOD principles to ensure modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 WeatherDashboardApp

The main application class that orchestrates all components.

Key responsibilities:
- Initialise and manage other components
- Handle user interactions
- Coordinate data flow between components

### 3.2 WeatherDataFetcher

Responsible for retrieving weather data from external sources.

Key responsibilities:
- Manage API connections
- Fetch raw weather data

### 3.3 WeatherAPIFactory

Creates appropriate WeatherAPI instances based on the desired API provider.

Key responsibilities:
- Instantiate specific WeatherAPI classes

### 3.4 WeatherAPI

An abstract base class for different weather API implementations.

Key responsibilities:
- Define interface for getting weather data

### 3.5 WeatherDataProcessor

Processes raw weather data into a standardised format.

Key responsibilities:
- Clean and normalise raw data
- Extract relevant information

### 3.6 WeatherVisualiser

Creates visual representations of weather data.

Key responsibilities:
- Generate forecast cards
- Create scatter plots and trend graphs

### 3.7 WeatherDisplayFactory

Creates appropriate WeatherDisplay instances based on the desired display type.

Key responsibilities:
- Instantiate specific WeatherDisplay classes

### 3.8 WeatherDisplay

An abstract base class for different weather data display implementations.

Key responsibilities:
- Define interface for showing weather data

## 4. Class Relationships

## 5. Key Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single, well-defined purpose.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: The system is open for extension (e.g., new API providers, display types) but closed for modification.
3. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
4. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating API and Display objects, allowing for easy extension.

## 6. Extensibility Points

1. Adding new weather API providers
2. Implementing new types of weather data displays
3. Extending data processing capabilities

## 7. Implementation Strategy

1. Implement core classes (WeatherDashboardApp, WeatherDataFetcher, WeatherAPI)
2. Develop data processing and visualisation components
3. Implement factory classes and concrete implementations
4. Integrate all components in the main application

## 8. Testing Approach

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. Mock external API calls for consistent testing

## 9. Future Considerations

1. User authentication and personalisation
2. Caching mechanism for improved performance
3. Support for additional weather data sources

This high-level design provides a roadmap for implementing the Weather Dashboard application, emphasising OOD principles and best practices in software development.
